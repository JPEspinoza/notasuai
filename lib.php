 * Library of interface functions and constants for module emarking
 * All the core Moodle functions, neeeded to allow the module to work
 * integrated in Moodle should be placed here.
 * All the emarking specific functions, needed to implement all the module
 * logic, should go to locallib.php. This will help to save some memory when
 * Moodle is performing actions across all modules.
